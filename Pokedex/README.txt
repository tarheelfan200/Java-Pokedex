Hi! This is a Pokedex (the catalog of all Pokemon) from the original Pokemon Games. It includes the original 151 Pokemon.

Access the Pokedex by running the aaMain file (1st file in src folder).
Select which Pokemon you'd like by entering the ID number.
The program will then return the Pokemon, along with it's typing.

You should be able to open the entire Pokedex module as a project, and it will run properly.

Hope you enjoy!
